### Student at Binghamton University

## About me 

Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student at Binghamton University, working toward a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and minoring in Digital and Data Studies (DIDA). 
I have a deep passion for calculus, analysis, and statistics, which has intrigued my growing interest in data science and data analytics. I'm eager to apply my 
mathematical background to real-world dataproblems and continue expanding my skills.
