For example, the demographics section at the beginning where you asked where are you from, the option to fill in a state was not required (because there might be people not from the US taking this) but the question about what county are you from was required (despite the fact that not everybody taking this will be from the US, which you did clarify in the questions).

The only question I found unclear was the one about the high school average out of 100. I was not sure what a high school average was (which might just be a me thing), or if you were asking for the average of something and just forgot to put the extra word in there. 

Other than those two things, I thought this survey was well put together and thorough in its questions. It did not take a long time to fill out and both the questions and answers were easy to understand. Nice job!",
